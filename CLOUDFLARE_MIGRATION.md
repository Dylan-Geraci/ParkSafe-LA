# ParkSafe-LA: Railway → Cloudflare Workers Migration

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated ParkSafe-LA API from Railway to Cloudflare Workers at $0 cost. All endpoints maintain identical behavior.

### What Changed
- **Backend**: Flask app on Railway → Cloudflare Worker
- **ML Model**: scikit-learn RandomForest → lightweight JavaScript rule-based algorithm
- **API**: Identical `/predict` endpoint behavior and response format
- **Frontend**: Added configurable API base URL via environment variable

### Commits Made
1. `f0532b0d` - Worker foundation + /health + CORS + GitHub Actions deploy
2. `62674fc5` - Complete /predict endpoint implementation
3. `df2525ce` - Frontend API URL configuration

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Deploy Worker (First Time Setup)
```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare (requires account)
wrangler login

# Deploy worker
wrangler deploy

# Note the deployed URL (e.g., https://parksafe-la-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev)
```

### 2. Test Worker Endpoints
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://parksafe-la-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health

# Test predict endpoint
curl -X POST https://parksafe-la-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"zipcode":"90210","day_of_week":"Friday","hour":"11","am_pm":"PM"}'
```

### 3. Update Frontend for Production
```bash
# In frontend directory, create .env.local file:
echo "REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://parksafe-la-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev" > frontend/.env.local

# Test frontend locally
cd frontend && npm start
# Verify form submission works with new API
```

### 4. Deployment Validation
- [ ] Worker health endpoint returns 200 status
- [ ] Predict endpoint returns expected JSON format: `{risk_level, prediction, probabilities, message}`
- [ ] CORS headers allow requests from your Vercel domain
- [ ] Frontend form submission works end-to-end
- [ ] GitHub Actions auto-deploy on main branch pushes

## Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback (if Worker fails)
1. **Frontend**: Remove/comment out `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in production env
   - This restores proxy behavior pointing to Railway
2. **Railway**: Ensure Railway app is still running (don't delete until confident)

### Complete Rollback Steps
```bash
# 1. Revert frontend changes
git revert df2525ce

# 2. Point Vercel deployment back to Railway
# In Vercel dashboard, update environment variables to remove REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL

# 3. Optionally remove Worker files
git revert 62674fc5 f0532b0d
```

## Cost Monitoring
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Free tier = 100,000 requests/day
- **Storage**: No persistent storage used (stateless API)
- **Overage Protection**: Worker will return 429 if free tier exceeded

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Worker performance and error rates
2. Once confident, shut down Railway app to stop charges
3. Update DNS/domains to point directly to Worker if desired
4. Consider adding basic analytics/monitoring if needed
